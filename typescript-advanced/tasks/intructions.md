1. Each error-fix problem may have multiple valid solutions. We encourage you to explore different approaches and submit as many variations as possible.

2. Create a pull request (PR) on your own branch to submit your solution.
Once the PR is created, share the pull request link for review.

3. In your pull request, add `Feruza12` as a reviewer, or alternatively, make your Git repository public so that it can be reviewed.
